                <p>Zipcy, whose real name is Yang Se Eun, is a 29-year-old artist from Seoul, South Korea, who is not afraid to add some sensual and lightly erotic elements to her creations.</p>
                <p>The "Touch" series portray moments of closeness in a couple's life. The artist manages to capture the intense feelings of the first stages of love. They cannot stand being apart and enjoy every little moment together.</p>
                <p>Take a look at some of the images from an ongoing "Touch" series and let us know which one was your favorite.</p>

                <p>Sam Cox is a 23-year-old artist better known as Mr Doodle.</p>
                <p> his work is about having fun, and not taking things too seriously. "A lot of art is lacking a sense of humour," says Cox. "It’s a fun thing to be able to draw and create your own world, and sometimes it is funny. I’m not afraid of people laughing at me or if they don’t get it."</p>
